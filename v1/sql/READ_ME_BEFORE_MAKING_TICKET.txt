To try and prevent users from loosing database info when we push SQL updates,
we put every SQL update in a seperate file as well easily being able to get 
imported.

-----------------
IF YOU HAVE NEVER INSTALLED Hydrid BEFORE, OR ARE DOING A FRESH INSTALL
USE "new users" SQL FILE.

IF YOU ALREADY HAVE HYDRID FUNCTIONAL, AND JUST NEED TO UPDATE THE DATABASE,
FIND THE UPDATE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR, SELECT THAT SQL FILE, AND IMPORT OR
EXECUTE IT.
